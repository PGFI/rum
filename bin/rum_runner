rum_runner - RNA-Seq Unified Mapper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  rum_runner align   -o dir [OPTIONS] [FORWARD [REVERSE]]
  rum_runner clean   -o dir [--very]
  rum_runner kill    -o dir
  rum_runner status  -o dir
  rum_runner version
  rum_runner help    [ACTION]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this program to run the RUM pipeline, as well as to do things like
check the status of a job, kill a job, and clean up after a job.

Every time you run rum_runner you must give it an action that tells it
what to do. When you run the pipeline using C<rum_runner align>,
rum_runner puts all of its output files in one directory, specified by
the B<-o> or B<--output> option. While the job is running you can
check the status by running C<rum_runner status -o I<dir>>, where
I<dir> is the output directory. You can kill it by running
C<rum_runner I<kill>> or C<rum_runner kill -o I<dir>>.
