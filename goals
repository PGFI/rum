* Check exit status of all system calls (or use autodie)

* Move most functionality from scripts into modules for reuse and testing

* Add unit tests

* Use more conventional directory structure and packaging (CPAN?)

* Be able to install in one place and run on files in another directory

* Add logging?

* Be able to restart at an intermediate step?

* Rather than have create_indexes_from_ucsc.pl actually run
  everything, maybe add an option that causes it to print out a
  Makefile.

* There are a few different scripts for sorting based on
  chromosome. Can we unify them?
